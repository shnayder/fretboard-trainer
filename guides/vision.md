# Vision & Roadmap

## Product Vision

<!-- [NEEDS INPUT] Fill in your vision for the product — what it should
     become, who it's for, what success looks like. The framing below is
     inferred from the codebase but may not match your actual intent. -->

Fretboard Trainer builds **automaticity** — instant, effortless recall of
music theory fundamentals. The goal is to take knowledge the user already
understands conceptually and drill it until it's reflexive.

## Design Principles

These are inferred from the existing codebase and design decisions:

- **Drill, not instruction.** The app assumes the user knows the theory. It
  trains speed and accuracy, not understanding. There are no lessons or
  explanations — just questions and immediate feedback.

- **Adaptive difficulty.** Practice what you're worst at. The adaptive
  selector prioritizes items with slow response times and low recall. Items
  you've mastered fade to the background.

- **Progressive disclosure.** Consolidate before expanding. New material
  (strings, distance groups, chord types) is gated behind mastery of what's
  already been started. This prevents overwhelming the learner with too many
  items at once.

- **Minimal friction.** Single-page app, instant start, works offline via
  service worker. No login, no cloud sync, no setup. Open the page and start
  drilling.

- **Short-session friendly.** Users often practice in free moments — a few
  minutes between activities. Every session should be productive without
  warm-up overhead. State that matters (item deadlines, mastery data) persists
  across sessions so progress carries over even when sessions are brief.

- **Fewer options.** Prefer smart defaults over user-facing toggles. Every
  option adds cognitive overhead ("should I turn this on?") and creates
  configurations to test. If the system can adapt automatically — via generous
  cold starts, staircase adjustments, or baseline scaling — do that instead
  of adding a setting.

- **Personalized timing.** Motor baseline calibration means thresholds adapt
  to each user's device and physical response speed. A phone user and a
  desktop keyboard user get equivalently challenging targets.

- **Clear screen states.** Each mode has distinct states (idle/stats, quizzing,
  calibrating). Each state should have its own clear layout — elements
  irrelevant to the current state hidden, content ordered by interaction
  priority. See [layout-and-ia.md](design/layout-and-ia.md) for details.

- **Label over inference.** Toggles, progress indicators, and data displays
  need text labels. Users shouldn't have to guess what `e B G D A E` means
  or what "3 / 13" represents.

## Current State

v3.5 with 10 quiz modes:

| Category | Modes |
|----------|-------|
| Fretboard geography | Fretboard, Speed Tap |
| Note/interval fundamentals | Note ↔ Semitones, Interval ↔ Semitones |
| Arithmetic | Semitone Math, Interval Math |
| Key-based theory | Key Signatures, Scale Degrees, Diatonic Chords |
| Chord construction | Chord Spelling |

All modes use the shared adaptive selector, forgetting model, and motor
baseline calibration.

## Roadmap

### Near-term

<!-- [NEEDS INPUT] Prioritize these or replace with your actual plans. -->

- Adaptive time pressure — per-item deadlines that tighten as the user
  improves, pushing from slow calculation to automatic recall
- Minor keys for Key Signatures, Scale Degrees, Diatonic Chords, Chord Spelling
- Chord spelling reverse direction (notes → chord name)

### Medium-term

<!-- [NEEDS INPUT] -->

- JSDoc type annotations + `tsc --noEmit` type checking (from architecture
  review Phase 5)
- Audio integration (hear intervals/chords, not just name them)
- Progress visualization beyond heatmaps

### Future considerations

<!-- [NEEDS INPUT] -->

- Multi-instrument support
- Custom practice sets / session goals
- Progress export/import
- Playwright-based visual dev tool (from architecture review Phase 4)

## Design Philosophy for New Features

Guidelines inferred from how existing modes were designed:

- **Each mode independently useful.** No cross-mode gating — all modes
  freely accessible from the hamburger menu. Recommended learning order is
  documented but not enforced.

- **Bidirectional drilling when applicable.** Forward (key → note) and
  reverse (note → key) are tracked as separate items. Mixing directions
  builds deeper fluency.

- **Group items by pedagogical difficulty.** Not alphabetical or numerical
  order. Easy/common items first (I-IV-V before iii-vii°, root+5th before
  2nd+6th).

- **Reuse shared infrastructure.** Adaptive selector, `computeRecommendations()`,
  `createStatsControls()`, `createNoteKeyHandler()`. A new mode should feel
  like a natural extension, not a separate app.

- **Stats visualization for every mode.** Users should always be able to see
  what they've mastered and what needs work. Heatmaps with Recall/Speed toggle.
