## Active
- Set up worktree-based parallel workstreams (this task)

## Backlog
- Periodic git cleanup: remove merged feature branches
- Set up notifications when web mode finishes (iOS/watch)
- Review and improvement process after every feature / bug fix batch
  - How could we have prevented the bug?
  - How could we have caught it with build-time tools (tests, linter)?
  - What patterns/libraries would make future work easier?
- Product spec review checklist + command (like code review)
- Post-merge clean-up checklist/trigger
- Regular code review cadence
- P2: Testing on a branch — dev server locally but phone needs merge
- Fix GH auto review config (get Claude to wait/respond automatically)
- Improve GH code review instructions
- Project timeline report/viz/analysis
- Use GH issues for backlog? Integrate with Claude?
- Tune local sandboxing
- Use up weekly token budget — backlog of tasks to run
- Size plans using XS-L (anything >L needs splitting)
- Linter setup
