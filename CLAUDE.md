# CLAUDE.md

Interactive music training app — fretboard note identification, interval math,
and more. Multiple quiz modes accessed via hamburger menu.

## Quick Start

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read main.ts          # Dev server
deno run --allow-write --allow-read main.ts --build # Build (Deno)
npx tsx build.ts                                    # Build (Node)
npx tsx --test src/*_test.ts                        # Run tests
```

**Always bump the version** (`<div class="version">` in both `main.ts` and
`build.ts`) with every change — even tiny fixes. Bump by 1 for normal changes
(v3.13 → v3.14 → v3.15). Bump the major version for large overhauls
(v3.x → v4.0).

**Both `main.ts` and `build.ts` use the same HTML template via shared helpers
in `src/html-helpers.ts`.** Mode-specific content is passed as arguments to
`modeScreen()`. Only the nav/header chrome and mode-specific quiz-area content
live directly in the build scripts.

## Architecture

Single-page vanilla JS app. All source files concatenated into one `<script>`
at build time — no framework, no bundler. Key patterns:

- **State + Render** — pure state transitions in `*-state.js` files, thin
  declarative `render()` in main files. Eliminates ordering and stale-UI bugs.
- **Mode Plugin Interface** — each mode is a `createXxxMode()` factory
  providing `getEnabledItems`, `presentQuestion`, `checkAnswer`, `handleKey`,
  `onStart`/`onStop`, plus `init`/`activate`/`deactivate` lifecycle hooks.
- **QuizEngine** — shared lifecycle (adaptive selection, 60-second round timer,
  feedback, keyboard/tap). Each mode gets its own engine instance.
- **Factory Pattern** — `createFretboardHelpers(musicData)` injects globals
  for testability without ES imports in concatenated code.
- **Adaptive Selector** — weighted random selection (unseen boost + EWMA).
  Injected storage for testability. Per-item forgetting model with half-life
  spaced repetition.
- **Motor Baseline** — per-provider calibration measuring physical response
  time. All timing thresholds scale proportionally (1x–9x baseline).
- **Consolidate Before Expanding** — shared `computeRecommendations()` gates
  progression to new item groups behind mastery of existing ones.
- **CSS Custom Properties** — color palette, heatmap scale, and semantic tokens
  defined as `--color-*` and `--heatmap-*` variables in `:root`. JS reads
  heatmap colors via `getComputedStyle` with hardcoded fallbacks for tests.
- **Build System** — `readModule()` strips `export` for browser; `read()` for
  plain scripts. Concatenation order = dependency order.

See [guides/architecture.md](guides/architecture.md) for module dependency
graph, algorithm details, and step-by-step "adding a new quiz mode" checklist.

## Quiz Modes

| Mode | Items | Answer type | Item ID format |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Guitar Fretboard | 78 (6 strings x 13 frets) | Note name | `0-5` (string-fret) |
| Ukulele Fretboard | 52 (4 strings x 13 frets) | Note name | `0-3` (string-fret) |
| Note ↔ Semitones | 24 (12 notes x 2 dirs) | Note or number 0-11 | `C:fwd`, `C:rev` |
| Interval ↔ Semitones | 24 (12 intervals x 2 dirs) | Interval or number 1-12 | `m2:fwd`, `m2:rev` |
| Semitone Math | 264 (12 notes x 11 x 2 dirs) | Note name | `C+3`, `C-3` |
| Interval Math | 264 (12 notes x 11 x 2 dirs) | Note name | `C+m3`, `C-P4` |
| Key Signatures | 24 (12 keys x 2 dirs) | Sig label or note | `D:fwd`, `D:rev` |
| Scale Degrees | 168 (12 keys x 7 degrees x 2 dirs) | Note or degree | `D:5:fwd`, `D:A:rev` |
| Diatonic Chords | 168 (12 keys x 7 degrees x 2 dirs) | Note or numeral | `Bb:IV:fwd`, `C:D:rev` |
| Chord Spelling | ~132 (12 roots x chord types) | Sequential notes | `C:major`, `F#:dim` |

Bidirectional modes track each direction as a separate item.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `C D E F G A B` — natural note (letter mode)
- `do re mi fa so la si` — natural note (solfège mode, case-insensitive)
- Letter/syllable + `#` / `b` — sharp/flat (`s` also works for sharp in letter mode)
- `0-9` — number (semitone modes)
- `Space` / `Enter` — next question
- `Escape` — stop quiz / return to home screen

## Guides

**Aspirational** — where the product is headed:

| Guide | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| [vision.md](guides/vision.md) | Who it's for, what we're building, tone, skill lifecycle |

**Enduring** — design values that should outlast any implementation:

| Guide | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| [design-principles.md](guides/design-principles.md) | Product, visual, and UX design principles |
| [layout-and-ia.md](guides/design/layout-and-ia.md) | Screen structure principles: states, hierarchy, grouping, labels |
| [process-principles.md](guides/process-principles.md) | Development process values and improvement goals |

**Current reference** — how things work today:

| Guide | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| [architecture.md](guides/architecture.md) | Module graph, build system, patterns, algorithms, DOM layout, adding new modes |
| [visual-design.md](guides/design/visual-design.md) | Color system, typography, spacing, component patterns |
| [coding-style.md](guides/coding-style.md) | Naming, file structure, DOM rules, testing patterns |
| [accidental-conventions.md](guides/accidental-conventions.md) | Sharp/flat naming rules by mode, rule priority |
| [terminology.md](guides/terminology.md) | User-facing terms and their internal equivalents |

**Process** — how to work on the codebase:

| Guide | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| [development.md](guides/development.md) | Commands, testing, versioning, branching, deployment, GitHub API |
| [feature-process.md](guides/feature-process.md) | When/how to write plans, design spec + implementation plan templates |
| [tech-debt-tracker.md](plans/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md) | Technical debt tracking |

The review checklist (`.claude/commands/review-checklist.md`) verifies these
conventions — use `/review` to run it.

## Workstreams

Four parallel worktrees with long-lived branches. Single user — separation is
about focus, not access control. Regular rebase from main keeps them in sync.

| Workstream | Branch | Focus |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Product | workstream/product | Specs, vision, backlog, feedback (docs only) |
| Design | workstream/design | HTML/CSS layers, visual design, component patterns |
| Engineering | workstream/engineering | JS behavior, state, algorithms, build system |
| Process | workstream/process | CI, Claude tooling, review commands, process docs |

**Overlap zones** — `main.ts`/`build.ts` and quiz render functions are touched
by both design and engineering. Rebase often; keep HTML/CSS and JS behavior
cleanly separated.

**Version bumps**: only engineering bumps the version number.

**Backlogs**: each workstream has its own in `backlogs/`. The old monolithic
`backlog.md` is archived at `backlogs/legacy.md`.

## GitHub API Access

`gh` CLI is not authenticated in the web environment. Use `curl` through the
egress proxy instead — see [development.md](guides/development.md#github-api-access-web-environment)
for the pattern.

## PR Requirements

All PRs that change code (not just docs/plans) follow this sequence:
1. Run `/review` until approved — don't wait for the user to ask.
2. Push the branch.
3. Create a PR with `gh pr create` (summary + test plan).
