# Feature Process

How to plan, design, implement, and document changes.

## Context

- `vision.md` describes the long-term vision, design principles, and roadmap.
  Relevant when making major design decisions, rarely relevant when following
  existing patterns.

## When to Write What

### Design spec

Write when there are **open design questions** about what to build. Typical
for new quiz modes, new UX patterns, or features where the question format,
item structure, or interaction model needs to be worked out.

Example: `plans/product-specs/completed/2026-02-11-new-quiz-modes-spec.md` —
designed question formats, item ID schemes, grouping, and answer input for 4 new
modes.

When reviewing specs, focus on requirements, goals, scope, phasing. Do not bring up code-level concerns unless they have significant impact on scope, performance, etc. It is expected that new code will be necessary -- no need to bring it up at this stage.

Principle: don't future-proof in most cases. There'll be time enough to refactor and add additional abstractions, info, etc when we want to actually use it. e.g. when tracking # of items done in a quiz, don't need to persist it until we actually plan to display the persisted value somewhere. 

### Implementation plan

Write when the **design is settled** but the technical approach has options,
touches multiple systems, or benefits from a written walkthrough.

Example: `plans/design-docs/2026-02-11-architecture-review.md` — phased
refactoring plan with code samples for each extraction step.

### Bug fix plan

Write for **non-trivial bugs** affecting multiple files or shared systems.
Skip for obvious single-file fixes.

Example: `plans/exec-plans/completed/2026-02-12-fix-chord-spelling-bugs.md` —
diagnosed 3 related enharmonic bugs, documented root causes, and planned fixes.

### Skip the spec

- small, straightfoward tweaks to existing features.
- bug fixes
- version bumps
- Significant technical improvements should get a spec, even if they're not user-facing. 

### Skip the plan

- Single-file bug fixes with obvious solutions
- CSS-only visual changes
- Version bumps
- Typo fixes

## Plan File Naming

```
plans/product-specs/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{short-description}-spec.md  -- goals, functional design, UX notes
plans/product-specs/completed/                                     -- move here when done, tested, signed off
plans/design-docs/YYYY-MM-DD-{short-description}.md               -- architectural explorations
plans/exec-plans/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{short-description}.md         -- implementation plans (in progress)
plans/exec-plans/completed/                                        -- move here when done
```

Use the date you start the work. Use kebab-case for the description.

## Plan Lifecycle

1. **Create** the spec and/or plan on the feature branch BEFORE starting
   implementation. Place in the appropriate subdirectory (`product-specs/active/`,
   `design-docs/`, or `exec-plans/active/`).
2. **Commit** the spec and plan as the first commit on the branch.
3. **Implement** the feature, referring to the plan.
4. **Update** the plan: add an "Implementation Notes" section documenting
   deviations, additions, or dropped scope.
5. **Move** exec plans from `active/` to `completed/` when the branch merges.
6. **Move** product specs from `active/` to `completed/` when the feature is
   done, tested, and signed off on.
7. **Commit** the updated plan alongside the implementation.

## Product Spec Review Checklist

Before considering a spec ready for review, verify:

- [ ] **Stays at product level.** No state shapes, function signatures,
  storage keys, or DOM structure. Those belong in the implementation plan.
- [ ] **Consistent with design principles.** Check `vision.md` — especially
  "fewer options" (can the system adapt instead of adding a toggle?) and
  "short-session friendly" (does state need to persist?).
- [ ] **Single user-facing metric where possible.** Avoid exposing internal
  distinctions (speed vs accuracy, timeout vs wrong) unless they're genuinely
  useful to the user.
- [ ] **Screen states described.** For UI features, describe what each screen
  state looks like (idle, quizzing, etc.) and the content priority order. See
  [layout-and-ia.md](design/layout-and-ia.md).
- [ ] **Labels and grouping specified.** New toggles, indicators, or data
  displays have labels. Related controls are grouped. No unlabeled elements.
- [ ] **Scope is clear.** Goals and non-goals are explicit. No feature creep
  disguised as "cross-cutting notes."
- [ ] **Decisions are resolved.** Each decision states the chosen option and
  the rationale. No "TBD" or "we could do X or Y."

## Architectural Review (Before Implementing)

Before writing code, verify that your design:

- **Integrates with existing patterns**: state machine phases, declarative
  `render()`, mode plugin interface, factory pattern. Don't introduce parallel
  mechanisms (shadow booleans, imperative DOM overrides). See
  [architecture.md](architecture.md) for pattern details.
- **Extends shared abstractions** when that's cleaner than working around them.
  If adding a new state phase to the engine, add it to `quiz-engine-state.js`.
- **Follows build system conventions**: `readModule()` for ES modules,
  correct concatenation position, template sync in both `main.ts` and
  `build.ts`. See [architecture.md](architecture.md#build-system).
- **Reuses shared helpers**: `computeRecommendations()` for progression,
  `createStatsControls()` for stats display, `createNoteKeyHandler()` for
  keyboard input, `deriveScaledConfig()` for timing thresholds.
- **Follows layout/IA principles**: content ordered by interaction priority
  per screen state, controls grouped and labeled, no redundant affordances.
  See [layout-and-ia.md](design/layout-and-ia.md).

## Templates

### Design Spec

````markdown

# {Feature Name}

## Problem / Context

What motivates this change. What's broken, missing, or being improved.

## Design

Technical approach:
- Data structures and state shape
- Key functions and signatures
- UI changes (HTML/CSS)
- Build integration (new files, readModule vs read, concatenation position)

## Implementation Steps

1. Step one (independently testable/verifiable)
2. Step two
3. ...

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/...` | Description |
| `main.ts` | Template + file reads |
| `build.ts` | Template + file reads |

## Testing

- New test cases
- Manual verification scenarios

````

## Updating Existing Plans

After implementation, always add an "Implementation Notes" section. This is
valuable for future reference — it documents what was actually built (vs.
planned), captures lessons learned, and helps future agents understand the
history of design decisions.

Include:
- **What was done**: brief summary of actual changes
- **Deviations from plan**: what changed and why
- **Test counts**: how many tests were added
- **Files modified**: final table (if it differs from the plan)

## Updating guides

When a change introduces a convention, pattern, or rule that future
development must follow, update the relevant guide(s) so the knowledge
isn't lost. Examples:

- New accidental naming rule → update `accidental-conventions.md` mode table
- New shared utility or pattern → update `architecture.md`
- New build step or workflow → update `development.md`
- New quiz mode → update the "Adding a New Quiz Mode" checklist

The test is: **if someone adding a new mode or feature would need to know
this to get it right, it belongs in a guide.** Don't rely on code comments
alone for cross-cutting concerns — they're too easy to miss.

Also update `CLAUDE.md` if the change affects the top-level overview
(new guide, new mode, changed commands).

## Updating tech-debt-tracker

- If the implementation created any new technical debt, add it to
  `plans/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`.
- If code review or bug fixes identified untracked existing debt, add it too.
