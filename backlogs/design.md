# Design Backlog

Owner: design workstream
Branch: workstream/design

## Active
- Improving visual design — layout, spacing, component system
- Cleaning up and reorganizing design guides
- Fretboard polish — fret markers, visual clutter. Remove accidentals? Allow not showing notes at all?

## Backlog
- Quiz view
  - remove x/y fluent bar. Not needed during quiz.
  - 
- Color system and brand identity
- UI language -- glossary, etc.
- Component documentation — visual-design.md has brief patterns, needs expansion
- Visual design iteration workflow — moments.html (build-generated), colors.html,
  and components.html exist; process documented in visual-design.md
- Think about, document tone — playful, formal, serious, laid back
- Mode headers design
- Full-screen modes, no header (part of home screen revamp)
- Landscape mode (or lock vertical)
- Speed check should be styled as a secondary action
- Don't use red/green scales (accessibility)
- Intervals displayed piano-style (like notes)
- Double tap zooms — it shouldn't (from user feedback)

## User Feedback (design-relevant)
- "What am I supposed to do?" — onboarding/discoverability
- "What does fluent mean?" — terminology clarity
- Make mistake -> frustrated — help set expectations via UI
- "Why are the recommended strings E & A?" — UI doesn't explain
