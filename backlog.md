# Prioritization principles
1. Make it work for me: major usefulness or usability blockers for me first
  - https://claude.ai/code/session_017bkZMbMGMKLvhm8EuMyHc9
1. Validate big risks or unknowns early -- e.g. what does it actually take to get into the app store. Will overall approach work.
1. Ongoing process and tech improvements -- pull in small ones regularly, larger ones every once in a while.

# In progress (WIP=3 major features, lots of bug fixes)
1. UI components, visual styling
  - https://claude.ai/code/session_017bkZMbMGMKLvhm8EuMyHc9
1. Have I practiced long enough? How many questions, what's my coverage + recall status?
  - needs review, tweaks -- visual, explanation of progress bar
1. Home screen: what skills exist, what's my status on each



# Backlog (Limit 5-10)
1. CSS smell, UI components, visual standards, etc -- eval and plan
1. What should I work on next recommendation?


# Done log
1. TWEAK: "You've got this" threshold is too low -- I don't feel like I got this - 
1. Code review command, agent. Needs testing.
1. BUG: Progress bar from plans/product-specs/2026-02-12-mid-quiz-status-spec.md not showing up
1. timeouts to keep user moving, push for automatization
